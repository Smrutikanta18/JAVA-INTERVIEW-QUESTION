1. What is java ?
    Java is class based, object- oriented programming and robust language .
java developed by Sun Microsystems in 1995, now owned by Oracle Corporation.
Java is platform indepedent, object oriented and secure.

2. Java is not 100% object oriented , Justify ?
    According to oops, Everything evolves arounds the object but java supports primitive datatype which are not object.
we use wrapper class to make it object oriented, which wrap the primitive datatype into object.

3. is pointer used in java ?
    No,
    -It increases code complexity.
    -It is unsafe.
    -JVM is responsible for memory allocation. 
        To avoid direct access to memory pointer is avoid.

4. Difference between Function and Method .
    -Function is written inside / outside of class in c++ but it is not used in java.
    -Method is written inside the class in java.
        and both are contains logic of code.

5. Java is robust language .
    Java is Strong it not easily crash. java hava excillent inbulid exception handling feature.

6. Java is a high Performance Language .

- JIT compiler :

interpreter in JVM is slows. So, JVM uses JIT (Just in time) compilers to convert bytecode into machine code
at runtime.
it increases execution speed.

-Multithreading :
JVM uses Several thread to executes different block of code at same time. 

-Scalability & portability.

7. JVM (Java virtual Machine) :
JVM is heart of the Java excution Process. it convert bytecode into machine code.

it identify the processer & operating system used in different computer.

.Java          ------------->   .class              ----------->  [ JVM ]  ---------> Machine code
(Source File)                 (Which contaion byte code)

(Object is created at heap)

8. Execution Engine: 
    Execution Engine contain both interpreter & JIT compiler which convert bytecode into machine code for better
performance.

9. 
Javac classname.java : Compile the program.
Java classname : Run the program file executed by calling JVM.

10. Java is platform/system independent .
    Bytecode is system independent 
    but JVM is system dependent,
    that convert byte code into machine code depending upon the system processor and operating system.
    so java is system independent.

11. JNI (Java native interface):
        It is a programming language that enable java code to interact with the code that is written in the other 
    programming language.

12.JRE (Java runtime environment) :
     It is a software that java required to run correctly.
            JRE contains
