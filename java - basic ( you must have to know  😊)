INTRODUCTION:
        The "father of Java" is James Gosling. He led the development of Java while working at Sun Microsystems,
    which was later acquired by Oracle Corporation.
    Java was first released in 1995 and has since become one of the most widely used programming languages
    in the world.

1. What is java ?
    Java is class based, object- oriented programming and robust language .
java developed by Sun Microsystems in 1995, now owned by Oracle Corporation.
Java is platform indepedent, object oriented and secure.

2. Java is not 100% object oriented , Justify ?
    According to oops, Everything evolves arounds the object but java supports primitive datatype which 
    are not object.
we use wrapper class to make it object oriented, which wrap the primitive datatype into object.

3. is pointer used in java ?
    No,
    -It increases code complexity.
    -It is unsafe.
    -JVM is responsible for memory allocation. 
        To avoid direct access to memory pointer is avoid.

4. Difference between Function and Method .
    -Function is written inside / outside of class in c++ but it is not used in java.
    -Method is written inside the class in java.
        and both are contains logic of code.

5. Java is robust language .
    Java is Strong it not easily crash. java hava excillent inbulid exception handling feature.

6. Java is a high Performance Language .

- JIT compiler :

interpreter in JVM is slows. So, JVM uses JIT (Just in time) compilers to convert bytecode into machine code
at runtime.
it increases execution speed.

-Multithreading :
JVM uses Several thread to executes different block of code at same time. 

-Scalability & portability.

7. JVM (Java virtual Machine) :
JVM is heart of the Java excution Process. it convert bytecode into machine code.

it identify the processer & operating system used in different computer.

.Java          ------------->   .class              ----------->  [ JVM ]  ---------> Machine code
(Source File)                 (Which contaion byte code)

(Object is created at heap)

8. Execution Engine: 
    Execution Engine contain both interpreter & JIT compiler which convert bytecode into machine code for better
performance.

9. About java code running .
Javac classname.java : Compile the program.
Java classname : Run the program file executed by calling JVM.

10. Java is platform/system independent .
    Bytecode is system independent 
    but JVM is system dependent,
    that convert byte code into machine code depending upon the system processor and operating system.
    so java is system independent.

11. JNI (Java native interface):
        It is a programming language that enable java code to interact with the code that is written in the other 
    programming language.

12. JRE (Java runtime environment) :
     It is a software that java required to run correctly.
            JRE contains

13. which method is used to call garbage collection ?
        System.gc()

14. Concrete method :-
        Method which is completly implemented in a class both have method body and header.
   Ex :
        public class Main{
                void display(){       //this method is conctere method with both body and header.
                        System.out.println("Hello");
                }
        public static void main(String[] args){
                Main m=new Main();
                m.display();
        }
        }

15. Heirarchy :-
        JAVA LIBRARY
             |
             |
          PACKAGE
             |
             |
        CLASS / INTEFACE
             |
             |
           METHOD

   EX :
        Java.util -> Package
        * -> all classes/interface in the respective package.

16. Difference between #include and import .
        #include :- This is used in c/c++.
                In this complier goes into the standard library and copy the needed code from header to the code.
                So that the program size increases.
        import :- this is used inn Java.
                In this compiler/JVM goes into the standard library and execute the needed code there and reduce
                the program size.
                So, no waste of memory is there.

17. About main() method :-
        i. In java, main() is the entry point of JVM to start execution.
        ii. JVM will not excute if there is no main() mathod.

        public static void main(String[] args)
                NOTE :- if (String[] args) is not there then code will compile but JVM will not run the code.
                     Because JVM required main() with String type array as parameter.

18. Class of which Package :-
String :- Class of java.lang package.
System :- Class of java.lang package.
        and 'out' is the static method of System class.
Object :- Class which is the super class of all the classes in java.
        present in java.lang package.
Scanner :- Class of java.util package.
        its object is used to obtaining the input of the primitive types like int, float etc.

java.lang package :-

    Object, String, Math, System, Thread,Throwable, Exception, RuntimeException,
    Integer, Double,Boolean.

java.util package :-

    ArrayList,LinkedList,HashMap,HashSet,TreeMap,TreeSet,Date,Calendar,
    Random,Collections,Arrays,Scanner.

java.io

    File,FileReader,FileWriter,BufferedReader,BufferedWriter,InputStream,
     OutputStream,ObjectInputStream,ObjectOutputStream.

java.net

    URL
    URLConnection
    HttpURLConnection
    InetAddress
    Socket
    ServerSocket.

java.sql

    Connection
    DriverManager
    ResultSet
    SQLException
    Statement
    PreparedStatement

java.time

    LocalDate
    LocalTime
    LocalDateTime
    ZonedDateTime
    Instant
    Duration
    Period

19. Difference between println() and print() method .
        println() :- print the output and move the cursur to the next line.
        print()   :- print the output and keep the cursur in same line.

20. Describe main() method of java.
        public static void main(String args[])
        public : acess modifier .It made available main() to JVM.
        static : it should be called without creating object.
        void : method does not return anything.
        main : method name.
        String args[] : main() takes parameter that is String type array name args.

21. Datatypes:

        byte == 1 byte
        short == 2 byte
        int == 4 byte
        float == 4 byte
        double == 8 byte
        long == 8 byte
        char == 2 byte

22. LITERALS:
        It represents the value that is stored in a variable directly in code.
        EX : 
                int age = 22
                        // 22 is literal.
