1. Define Polymorphism.
  Ability to exists in more than one form.
  Example : A person can be a doctor, father, teacher
          Husband etc.
  It increases code flexibility. we can use one method
  for defferent operation.

2. How we can achieve polymorphism ?
  we can achieve polymorphism in two ways
    i. Runtime / Dynamic Polymorphism :
          Which is execute as runtime and achieved by Method
        overriding.
    ii. compile / Static Polymorphism :
          Which is execute as compiletime and achieved by
        Method / Constructor overloading.

3. Difference between Method Overloading and overriding.
    METHOD OVERLOADING : 
          - Two/More Method with same name and same parameter
          and same return type.
          - For method overloading there must be a IS-A 
          relationship.
          - Used to achieve runtime polymorphism.
    METHOD OVERRIDING : 
          - Two/More Method with same name but different parameter
          and same/different return type.
          - For method overloading there must be a IS-A 
          relationship.
          - Used to achieve runtime polymorphism.
